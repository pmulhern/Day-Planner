## Aplication

```
Allows user to enter tasks for standard working hours 9AM to 5PM.
Tasks are stored to the Local Drive and retrieved from the same.
There is a button to clear all stored items as users may want to start fresh day over day.
The time slots change colors as the hours progress:
    Gray - Time of day has passed
    Blue - Represents the current hour
    Green - Represents future time periods
```


## Code

```
Majority of functional code is leveraging JavaScript and jQuery with special emphasis on each and for loops to cut down on repitive code.  

```
